?Which instrument is used to measure the total energy of the Sun falling on the surface at a certain time?
+ Pyrheliometer (correct)
- Spectrobolometer
- Thermometer
- Pyranometer
?Which instrument is used to measure the solar energy absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere?
- Pyrheliometer
+ Spectrobolometer (correct)
- Thermometer
- Barometer
?How does the spectrobolometer measure the radiation intensity?
- By measuring the energy in the infrared spectrum
- By calculating the total energy from all wavelengths
+ By drawing a graph that characterizes the relationship of the radiation intensity of each wavelength to the air mass (correct)
- By measuring the temperature of the solar radiation
?What is the "air mass" in the context of solar radiation measurements?
- The total amount of solar energy absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere
+ The quantity measured by the ratio of the optical thickness of the air layer in a certain direction to its optical thickness in the zenith direction (correct)
- The intensity of radiation absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere
- The total radiation emitted by the Sun
?What additional information is used to calculate the solar constant?
- The total energy absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere
+ The distribution of energy in the solar spectrum determined by the spectrobolometer (correct)
- The energy emitted by the Sun in ultraviolet radiation only
- The temperature of the Sun's surface
?How is the solar constant measured?
- By comparing it to the energy reflected by the Earth
- By calculating the solar energy reflected by the Earth's atmosphere
+ By making hundreds of observations and calculations using a pyrheliometer and spectrobolometer (correct)
- By measuring the temperature on the Earth's surface
?What role do satellites play in measuring the solar constant?
- They measure the total solar energy reflected by the Earth
+ They measure the radiation energy in the ultraviolet and infrared regions of the Sun's spectrum (correct)
- They calculate the Sun's surface temperature
- They measure the solar constant at ground level
?How is the total energy of the Sun determined?
- By adding the solar constant and the amount of energy absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere
+ By multiplying the solar constant by the surface area of a sphere with a radius of 1 astronomical unit (correct)
- By calculating the total energy emitted in the infrared spectrum
- By measuring the total energy received on Earth's surface
