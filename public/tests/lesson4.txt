?What is the first condition of equilibrium within the Sun?
- The total energy emitted by the Sun
+ Hydrostatic equilibrium, where gravitational and pressure forces are balanced 
- The conservation of energy in the Sun
- The temperature gradient within the Sun
?What does the mass distribution equation describe in the Sun's structure?
- The total amount of energy emitted by the Sun
+ The mass within a given radius from the center of the Sun 
- The rate of energy dissipation in the Sun
- The temperature profile of the Sun
?What is the main factor that determines the energy dissipation in the Sun?
- The energy absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere
- The total energy radiated by the Sun's surface
+ The energy released in the Sun's core, which then reaches the surface
- The heat generated in the outer layers of the Sun
?How is the temperature gradient within the Sun determined?
- By calculating the mass distribution and energy flow
- By measuring the solar constant
+ By considering the form of energy transfer (convection, conduction, or radiation)
- By observing the Sun's surface temperature
?What is the role of radiative transfer in the Sun's energy movement?
- It causes convection currents to form
+ It transfers energy from the core of the Sun to the outer layers via radiation
- It mixes the material of the Sun's core
- It prevents the Sun from losing energy
?What does the radiative temperature gradient depend on?
- The temperature at the surface of the Sun
+ The energy flow, radiation constant, and absorption coefficient 
- The temperature of the outer layers
- The chemical composition of the Sun's core
?What happens when light migration becomes inefficient in the Sun's interior?
- The energy is radiated outward more efficiently
+ More effective energy-releasing actions such as convection take over 
- The temperature gradient becomes steeper
- The Sun's core cools down
?What is the adiabatic equation of state used for in the Sun's structure?
- To calculate the mass distribution in the Sun
- To determine the energy flow in the Sun's core
+ To describe the temperature and pressure of rising gas in convective movements 
- To measure the radiation from the Sun's surface
?What does the convective temperature gradient depend on?
- The distance from the Sun's center
- The radiation flux in the outer layers
+ The adiabatic exponent and the temperature, density, and chemical composition of the gas 
- The energy released from the Sun's core
?What is the purpose of boundary conditions in the Sun's equilibrium equations?
- To calculate the energy released in the Sun's core
+ To properly define the conditions for solving the differential equations, such as temperature and pressure at the surface (correct)
- To determine the temperature gradient in the Sun's core
- To calculate the Sun's mass and radius
