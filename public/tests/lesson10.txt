?What was the early theory of the origin of sunspots based on?
+ Adiabatic cooling of gas in the light equilibrium region
- Magnetic field suppression
- Heat energy convection
- Hydrogen convective zone
?Who proposed the theory of sunspot origin based on adiabatic cooling in 1921?
- Birman
+ Ressel
- Rosseland
- Hale
?What difficulty arose for the theory of adiabatic cooling after the discovery of the hydrogen convective zone?
+ It conflicted with the convective processes in the Sun's surface layer.
- It could not explain the formation of solar flares.
- It underestimated the strength of the Sun's magnetic field.
- It failed to account for sunspot temperature variations.
?What did Birman propose in 1941 about the origin of sunspots?
+ Magnetic field convection slows down energy flow, causing cooling.
- Sunspots form due to massive explosions on the Sun's surface.
- Convection energy rises along the magnetic field lines.
- Sunspots are created by solar wind disturbances.
?What observation undermined Birman's theory?
- The granules in the sunspot's core resembled those in the photosphere.
+ Granule cells were observed in the shadow part of the spots.
- The magnetic field lines were not aligned with the Sun's surface.
- Sunspots were found to emit more radiation than expected.
?What is the basis of Hale's hypothesis on sunspot formation?
- Magnetic field lines direct energy flow in sunspots, causing cooling.
+ Convection energy rises along magnetic field lines, cooling over a large area.
- Heat energy is trapped below the Sun's surface, causing sunspot formation.
- Solar radiation forms a barrier, reducing sunspot temperature.
?What is the modern understanding of sunspot cooling?
+ Magnetic field partially inhibits convection, reducing energy transfer to the surface.
- Solar flares suppress convection, leading to sunspot formation.
- Sunspots are purely caused by energy fluctuations in the photosphere.
- The Sun's rotation contributes to cooling in sunspot areas.
?What type of spectrum do sunspots have?
+ Absorption spectrum, like the photosphere
- Emission spectrum
- Continuous spectrum
- X-ray spectrum
?In the spectrum of sunspots, what happens to spectral lines with a small awakening potential?
- They decrease in intensity.
+ They increase in intensity compared to the photosphere.
- They remain unchanged.
- They completely disappear.
?How are spectral lines in the sunspot spectrum different from those of the quiescent photosphere?
+ They shift to the red or violet side, indicating motion.
- They are sharper and more defined.
- They remain the same but become brighter.
- They completely disappear in the spot area.
?What does a positive shift in the spectral line wavelength indicate?
+ The plasma mass moves away from the observer.
- The plasma mass moves towards the observer.
- The plasma remains stationary.
- The plasma is in the same position relative to the observer.
?What is the Zeeman effect observed in the spectrum of sunspots?
- Spectral lines split due to varying temperatures in the sunspot.
+ Spectral lines split into components due to the magnetic field.
- Spectral lines change color depending on the Sun's position.
- Spectral lines show no shift or splitting.
?How many components can the spectral line split into in the presence of a strong magnetic field in the sunspot's nucleus?
- One
+ Two or three components
- Four
- No splitting occurs.
?If the magnetic field strength vector is in the same direction as the line of sight, how many components does the spectral line split into?
+ Two components, rotationally polarized
- Three components, linearly polarized
- One component, unpolarized
- No splitting occurs.
?How does the intensity of the components behave when the magnetic field strength vector is aligned with the line of sight?
+ The intensity of the components is proportional to each other.
- The intensity of one component is much higher than the other.
- The components have no intensity relationship.
- The components are completely polarized.
?What happens when the magnetic field strength vector is at a 90° angle to the line of sight?
+ The spectral line splits into three components, linearly polarized.
- The spectral line disappears completely.
- The spectral line remains unaltered.
- The intensity of the components becomes unpredictable.
?What is the polarization state of the components when the magnetic field forms an angle of 90° with the line of sight?
- Unpolarized
+ Linearly polarized
- Radially polarized
- Circularly polarized
