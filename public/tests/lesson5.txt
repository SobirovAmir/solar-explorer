?How is the solar constant calculated?
- By multiplying the intensity by the air mass
- By calculating the total energy emitted by the Sun
+ By measuring the energy passing through a 1 cm² surface and correcting for absorption by the Earth's atmosphere 
- By calculating the total energy absorbed by the Earth
?What is the air mass in the context of solar radiation measurements?
- The density of solar radiation
+ The ratio of the optical thickness of the air layer in a certain direction to its optical thickness in the zenith direction (correct)
- The total amount of energy absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere
- The total energy received by the Earth
?What is the role of satellites in determining the solar constant?
- They measure the total energy emitted by the Sun

?How is the total energy of the Sun found?
- By adding the solar constant to the amount of energy absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere
- By calculating the total energy emitted by the Sun at all wavelengths
+ By multiplying the solar constant by the surface area of a sphere with a radius of 1 astronomical unit 
- By measuring the total solar energy reflected by the Earth
?What is the main reason why the energy radiated by the Sun is important for life on Earth?
