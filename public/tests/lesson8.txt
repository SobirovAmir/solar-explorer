?What are the three main layers of the Sun's atmosphere?
- Photosphere, Chromosphere, and Exosphere
- Photosphere, Corona, and Convective Zone
+ Photosphere, Chromosphere, and Corona
- Convective Zone, Radiation Zone, and Core
?What is the field where nuclear reactions take place in the Sun?
+ The field of nuclear reactions (Core)
- The radiation field
- The convective field
- The photospheric field
?Which part of the Sun is responsible for energy transport by radiation?
- The field of nuclear reactions
+ The radiation field
- The convective field
- The photosphere
?What is the main characteristic of the Sun's convective field?
- Energy is transported by radiation
+ Energy is mainly transported by convection
- No energy transport occurs
- Energy is transported by magnetic fields
?What can be observed in the Sun's photosphere?
- Solar flares and sunspots only
+ Granulation, flares, and sunspots
- Only sunspots
- Only granulation
?What did Jansen and Gansky first study about the Sun?

- 3-4 minutes
+ 6-7 minutes
- 10-12 minutes
- 15-20 minutes
?What did the "Stratoscope-2" solar station reveal about granules?
+ Granules are convective cells with increased gas flow in the center
- Granules are regions of constant temperature
- Granules are areas of magnetic field concentration
- Granules have no gas flow
?What is the primary feature of sunspots in relation to the Sun's photosphere?
- They are areas of high temperature
+ They are affected by the Sun's magnetic field
- They are always visible at the center of the Sun's disk

?How do solar flares compare to the Sun's photosphere in terms of brightness?
- Flares are 5-10% brighter
+ Flares are 10-20% brighter
- Flares are 50% brighter
- Flares are dimmer
?Where can solar flares be observed?
- In the center of the Sun's disk
+ Near the edges of the Sun's visible disk
- Only at the poles of the Sun
- Only during solar eclipses
